// MARK: - Agent Tracer Protocol

/// Protocol defining the contract for tracing agent execution events.
///
/// `AgentTracer` is the core abstraction for observability in SwiftAgents.
/// Implementations can log to console, send to telemetry systems, or store events for analysis.
///
/// ## Conformance Requirements
///
/// - Must be an `actor` (inherited from protocol requirements)
/// - Must be `Sendable` for safe concurrent access
/// - All methods are implicitly `async` due to actor isolation
///
/// ## Example Implementation
///
/// ```swift
/// public actor CustomTracer: AgentTracer {
///     private var events: [TraceEvent] = []
///
///     public func trace(_ event: TraceEvent) async {
///         events.append(event)
///         print("[TRACE] \(event)")
///     }
///
///     public func flush() async {
///         print("Flushing \(events.count) events")
///         events.removeAll()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let tracer: AgentTracer = ConsoleTracer(minimumLevel: .info)
///
/// await tracer.trace(.agentStart(
///     traceId: traceId,
///     agentName: "MyAgent"
/// ))
/// ```
public protocol AgentTracer: Actor, Sendable {
    /// Traces an event.
    ///
    /// Implementations should handle the event appropriately based on their purpose
    /// (e.g., logging, storing, forwarding to telemetry systems).
    ///
    /// - Parameter event: The trace event to record.
    func trace(_ event: TraceEvent) async

    /// Flushes any buffered events.
    ///
    /// This method provides a hook for tracers that buffer events to ensure
    /// they are persisted or transmitted. The default implementation is a no-op.
    func flush() async
}

// MARK: - Default Implementation

extension AgentTracer {
    /// Default flush implementation that does nothing.
    ///
    /// Override this method in your tracer if you need to flush buffered events.
    public func flush() async {
        // Default: no-op
    }
}

// MARK: - Composite Tracer

/// A tracer that forwards events to multiple child tracers.
///
/// `CompositeTracer` enables fan-out tracing patterns, where a single event
/// is sent to multiple destinations (e.g., console + file + telemetry service).
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - Filters events by minimum level before forwarding
/// - Supports parallel or sequential event forwarding
/// - Gracefully handles failures in individual tracers
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let tracer = CompositeTracer(
///     tracers: [consoleTracer, fileTracer, telemetryTracer],
///     minimumLevel: .info,
///     parallel: true
/// )
///
/// await tracer.trace(event) // Forwards to all three tracers in parallel
/// ```
public actor CompositeTracer: AgentTracer {
    /// The child tracers to forward events to.
    private let tracers: [any AgentTracer]

    /// The minimum event level to forward. Events below this level are discarded.
    private let minimumLevel: EventLevel

    /// Whether to forward events in parallel (true) or sequentially (false).
    private let parallel: Bool

    /// Creates a composite tracer.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - tracers: The child tracers to forward events to.
    ///   - minimumLevel: Minimum event level to forward. Default: `.trace` (all events).
    ///   - parallel: Whether to forward events in parallel. Default: `true`.
    public init(
        tracers: [any AgentTracer],

        parallel: Bool = true
    ) {
        self.tracers = tracers
        self.minimumLevel = minimumLevel
        self.parallel = parallel
    }

    public func trace(_ event: TraceEvent) async {
        // Filter events below minimum level
        guard event.level >= minimumLevel else { return }

// MARK: - No-Op Tracer

/// A tracer that discards all events.
///
/// `NoOpTracer` is useful for:
/// - Testing scenarios where tracing is not needed
/// - Disabling tracing in production without code changes
/// - Default tracer values in APIs
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let tracer: AgentTracer = NoOpTracer()
/// await tracer.trace(event) // Event is discarded
/// ```
public actor NoOpTracer: AgentTracer {
    /// Creates a no-op tracer.

        // Intentionally empty
    }
}

// MARK: - Buffered Tracer

/// A tracer that buffers events and flushes them in batches to a destination tracer.
///
/// `BufferedTracer` reduces overhead by batching trace events and flushing them
/// periodically or when the buffer reaches capacity. This is particularly useful
/// for high-throughput scenarios or when sending events to remote systems.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - Automatic flush when buffer reaches `maxBufferSize`
/// - Periodic flush based on `flushInterval`
/// - Thread-safe buffering using actor isolation
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let destination = ConsoleTracer()
/// let buffered = BufferedTracer(
///     destination: destination,
///     maxBufferSize: 100,
///     flushInterval: .seconds(5)
/// )
///
/// // Events are buffered until 100 events or 5 seconds
/// await buffered.trace(event1)
/// await buffered.trace(event2)
/// // ... more events ...
///
/// // Manually flush if needed
/// await buffered.flush()
/// ```
