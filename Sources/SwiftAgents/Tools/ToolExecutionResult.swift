// MARK: - ParallelExecutionErrorStrategy

/// Strategy for handling errors during parallel tool execution.
///
/// When executing multiple tools concurrently, errors can occur in any of them.
/// This enum defines how the executor should respond to these errors.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let executor = ParallelToolExecutor()
///
/// // Fail immediately on first error (cancels remaining tasks)
/// let results = try await executor.executeInParallel(
///     calls, using: registry, agent: agent, context: nil,
///     errorStrategy: .failFast
/// )
///
/// // Collect all errors and throw composite error at end
/// let results = try await executor.executeInParallel(
///     calls, using: registry, agent: agent, context: nil,
///     errorStrategy: .collectErrors
/// )
///
/// // Continue execution and include failures in results
/// let results = try await executor.executeInParallel(
///     calls, using: registry, agent: agent, context: nil,
///     errorStrategy: .continueOnError
/// )
/// ```

    ///
    /// When any tool execution fails, the executor immediately throws the error
    /// and cancels any remaining tool executions. This is the fastest way to
    /// fail but may leave some tools unexecuted.

    /// Collect all errors and throw a composite error at the end.
    ///
    /// All tool executions complete (or fail), and if any errors occurred,
    /// a composite error containing all failures is thrown after completion.
    /// This ensures all tools are attempted before failing.
    case collectErrors

    /// Continue execution and include failures in results.
    ///
    /// All tool executions complete, and failures are captured in the

/// Captures comprehensive information about a tool execution including
/// the tool name, arguments, result (success or failure), timing, and timestamp.

/// while preserving detailed execution metadata.

/// ```swift
/// let result = ToolExecutionResult(
///     toolName: "weather",
///     arguments: ["location": .string("San Francisco")],
///     result: .success(.string("72F and sunny")),
///     duration: .milliseconds(150),
///     timestamp: Date()
/// )
///
/// if result.isSuccess {
///     print("Tool \(result.toolName) returned: \(result.value!)")
/// } else {
///     print("Tool \(result.toolName) failed: \(result.error!)")
/// }
