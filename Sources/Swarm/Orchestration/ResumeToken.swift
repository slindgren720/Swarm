// MARK: - ResumeToken

/// A non-copyable token that represents a suspended orchestration point.
///
/// `ResumeToken` captures the state of an orchestration at the point of
/// interruption, allowing it to be resumed later. Because it conforms to
/// `~Copyable`, the compiler ensures the token can only be consumed once --
/// preventing double-resume bugs at compile time.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// // Create a token when suspending an orchestration
/// var token = ResumeToken(
///     suspensionPoint: "approval-gate",
///     capturedInput: currentInput,
///     capturedStep: nextStep,
///     capturedContext: context
/// )
///
/// // Later, resume the orchestration
/// let result = try await token.resume(with: "approved")
///
/// // Or cancel it
/// // token.cancel()
/// ```
