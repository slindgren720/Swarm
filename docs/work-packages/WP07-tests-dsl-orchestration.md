Prompt:
Update tests for new DSLs and single-root orchestration; add coverage for new behavior.

Goal:
Ensure behavior is validated under Swift Testing with TDD-first updates.

Task Breakdown:
- Update blueprint tests to new body signature.
- Update Router usages to When/Otherwise.
- Update SwiftUI DSL integration tests.
- Add new tests for OrchestrationGroup, ParallelItem, Router step bodies, loop type preservation.

Expected Output:
- Tests compile and reflect new DSLs.
- New tests cover key behavior and edge cases.

Constraints:
- Swift Testing only; deterministic, behavior-focused tests.
